Making a conclusion recipe to sum everything up will be really appreciated.

- gem install the gem 'omniauth-github'

- Create application
  https://github.com/settings/applications/new

- Add the keys provided by github t
  ENV['GITHUB_APP_KEY']
  ENV['GITHUB_APP_SECRET']

- Set the omniauth builder in the config file
  config/initializers/omniauth.rb
  Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :github, ENV['GITHUB_APP_KEY'], ENV['GITHUB_APP_SECRET'], scope: "user, gist" Not really sure what these scopes are
  end

- Create user model to store the user attributes
    t.string :provider
    t.string :remote_id
    t.string :name
    t.string :token

- get '/auth/:provider/callback' Is this a route set by the gem
  routes:
    get '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create'
    get '/auth/failure', to: 'sessions#failure'
    delete '/sessions', to: 'sessions#destroy'

  Controller:
    class SessionsController < ApplicationController
      def create
        auth = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
        @user = User.find_or_create_by!(remote_id: auth.uid, provider: "github") do |user|
          user.name = auth.info.nickname
          user.token = auth.credentials.token
        end
        session[:user_id] = @user.id
        flash[:info] = "You have signed in with GitHub."
        redirect_to root_path
      end

      def failure
        flash[:danger] = "Authorization failed."
        redirect_to root_path
      end
    end

- Set up the log in link:
   <p class="navbar-text"><%= link_to "Sign in with GitHub", '/auth/github' %></p>
   This is a bit magical cus this route does not exist in the app

Assignment: Gists Index
Wrong number of arguments when defining the Page.struck
Page = Struct.new(:items)
but then
Page.new(1, 1, items)?
